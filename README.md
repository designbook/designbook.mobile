design.book
-----------
design.book is a mobile application for designers and design enthusiasts
to document, organize, and share their design journeys with each other.
By giving designers a quick way to curate their process, the app helps
them visualize and communicate their process in different ways.

Our motivation around creating design book is to allow design
enthusiasts to peer into the process and techniques of other designers
and learn from each others experiences. 

The application guides a user or a team as they follow a design process,
allowing them to visually capture details about different design
activities such as brainstorming, mind-maps, user scenarios, interview
etc. Since the app captures the various stages and activities of the
design process, users can share their experiences of designing products
